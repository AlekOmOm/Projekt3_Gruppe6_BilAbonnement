## UML Artifacts



### Overview

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
The creation of UML was originally motivated by the desire to standardize the disparate notational systems and approaches to software design.
It was developed by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh at Rational Software in 1994.
UML was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) and UML 1.0 specification draft was proposed to the OMG in January 1997.
UML is a
- standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.
- diagramming language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems.
  UML includes a set of graphic notation techniques to create visual models of object-oriented software-intensive systems.
  UML combines techniques from data modeling (entity relationship diagrams), business modeling (workflows), object modeling, and component modeling.
  It can be used with all processes, throughout the software development life cycle, and across different implementation technologies.

### Artifact
An artifact is a concrete entity that is produced during the software development process. It can be a document, a diagram, a model, a program file, or a test script.
